# SINGLE PAGE APPLICATION

## Description of the project:
 This is a excersice where i am practiving the creation of a single page application base of MIT excersice. I refactored the single-page application, integrating the books exercise using web components with React components to display the books within one of the links of the SPA. Changes included inserting links into the bootstrap navbar by adding the location.hash to the href attribute of the button and incorporating an onclick attribute to trigger the loadPage function for each link. Though I attempted to switch from using fetch to axios, I faced challenges in integrating the axios library into the project. Then, I opted to continue using fetch as it proved functional. I figured if it ain't broke, why fix it? So I just left it as is and let it keep doing its thing. My design decisions were motivated by aesthetics and the desire to combine exercises from this module into one cohesive project. Despite challenges with axios integration, I would like to deepen my understanding of axios usage in various contexts such as HTML standard, React standalone, and within a React app projects.

## How to Run:

## Roadmap of future improvements:
There are quite a few improvements I have in mind. Firstly, I'd like to focus on refactoring the code to enhance its clarity and readability. Additionally, I want to ensure better integration of libraries; sometimes my link "Books" works, and other times it doesn't, which I suspect might be related to caching. So, I'll delve deeper into investigating that issue.
